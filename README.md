The following is from the original ReadMe File, written by Jim Albright

    Dramatizer produces a series of scripts that will be helpful to the director and recordist in making an audio dramatized version of a portion of the Bible.
    Dramatizer produces a master script for human use and also a master script for the computer to use.
    Dramatizer produces a script for each speaker (voice talent) with just his/her clips.
    Dramatizer links to Cool Edit or Audacity or Audition or your audio recording program with the proper wave file to record for a particular clip.
    Recordings can be done in sequence or out of sequence (by speaker number) or a combination of these.
    Dramatizer helps organize the hundreds or thousands of wave files created.
    The interface can be localized. French and Portuguese are currently available. 

Note: be sure to uninstall older versions of Dramatizer before installing a newer version. Your work will remain. Just the program and related files are uninstalled.

The menus are able to be modified into other languages now. Please send me the modified localization.txt file. It is located where you installed Dramatizer in a folder called requiredFiles. I will include your language in the next distribution.
